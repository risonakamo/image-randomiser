# prototype
- session select
- session create
    - drag in folders to add
    -
- session viewer
    - button to open selected item in certain programs
    - ability to drag items into other programs

# questions
- is there value is randomising a folder link?
    - sometimes just looking for ideas, and some items are repetitive cg in a folder. in this case, providing the entire folder is better than including every item as a possible selectable item. but how to indicate the folder is to be a "top level item"
        - what if could select any item and choose to mark its parent folder as a "top level item"

# prototype testing
main risk factor:
- if select a bunch of folders and do session based randomisation, does this actually help find anything vs just randomising on the main image folder
- will the repetitve cgs get in the way?
- is presenting a set of random images any better than 1 at a time?
- is there anyway to get the same test experience without building anything
    - xn view slideshow doesn't work as well due to huge limitations such as 1 image at a time, not able to find the src of the img easily

# prototype build plan
- build a test viewer hardcoded on some folders
- needs to have session
- needs to support drag/open in target programs
